We are all born with strong needs for emotional security. Love, acceptance, safety, freedom, 
and physical intimacy are what we initially build our self-worth on, and how much attention 
we receive as children is a strong determinant of that. The interesting thing 
about these specific needs is that they are heavily remembered and integrated 
within the cellular composition of our bodies, they are felt rather than understood, 
and hence why they stay with us until we pass on from life as we know it. When 
we are born and throughout our childhood, we are dependent on the adults around us 
for survival and therefore these needs are primal and can only be fully fulfilled in the early 
stages of our lives, as we grow older and become independent adults, those same needs become
more flexible since we are not so reliant on those around us and they are then not heavily connected to our
continuity in life.
